# JARVIS Memory

This file serves as a template for JARVIS's persistent memory.
It will be automatically populated as JARVIS learns about you.

## Getting Started

When you first interact with JARVIS, it will begin to remember:

- Your preferences and how you like things done
- Important facts about you and your work
- Active projects and their context
- Your patterns and routines

## Memory Format

JARVIS stores memories in JSON format for reliability, but you can 
also view and edit this file directly if needed.
